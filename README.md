# Cybersecurity AI

## Overview

The **Cybersecurity AI** project is designed to detect and manage anomalies in network traffic data using machine learning techniques.
This project leverages the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing anomalies.

## Features

- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies anomalies in network traffic data.
- **GUI Visualization:** Displays anomalies on a scatter plot for easy visualization.
- **Automated Fixes:** Attempts to block detected anomalies on your local machine.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

## Understanding the Anomaly Detection Plot
In the scatter plot generated by the script:

- Blue Dots: Represent anomalies detected by the model. These are points in the data that deviate significantly from the normal pattern of network traffic.
- Red Dots: Represent normal data points that are considered typical and do not exhibit unusual behavior.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib`
- `subprocess` (Python Standard Library)
- `socket` (Python Standard Library)
- `platform` (Python Standard Library)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn joblib
```
